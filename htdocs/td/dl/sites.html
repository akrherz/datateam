<h4>Plot Map Considerations</h4>

<ul>
<li>Site maps included below will often include plot numbers; these align with 
the plot identifiers listed with the data.</li>

<li>The maps however may contain treatment codes that do not match the data;
these are unique to that location and were changed afterwards to align with
codes used across Transforming Drainage sites.</li>

<li>Some experiments include treatments beyond those that were part of the 
Transforming Drainage which can be seen in the plot map.</li>

</ul>
