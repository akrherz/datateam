# ISU Data Team Repository

The code in this repository is used by a team of collaborators at Iowa State University to manage data coming from a number of trans-disciplinary and multi-institution agricultural research projects.

The [ISU Data Team](https://datateam.agron.iastate.edu) homepage is a public facing website offering a number of download and exploration tools from two USDA CAP Grants.
